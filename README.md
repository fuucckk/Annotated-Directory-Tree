## Project Introduction

> This project is based on [folder-explorer](https://github.com/d2-projects/folder-explorer) and has been further developed. Thanks to [FairyEver](https://github.com/FairyEver) for the creativity and contribution!

This is my first official open-source project. If it helps you, please Star ‚≠êÔ∏è and share it with your friends. It means a lot to me, thank you üíó!

The project is currently in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage. If you have any opinions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me through the following ways:

- Submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/itchaox/annotree/issues)

## Why Further Development

1. Some features of folder-explorer were redundant for me and didn't fit my usage habits.
2. In folder-explorer, you need to export to see the configuration effect each time, which I found inconvenient. I wanted real-time preview.
3. When editing notes in folder-explorer, you need to right-click to open the edit note menu each time, which I personally found not very convenient.

## Features

1. ‚ú® Real-time preview: View the annotated file tree effect in real-time without exporting text, making document writing more intuitive and efficient.
2. üñä Convenient annotation: Easily write annotations by switching input boxes, avoiding cumbersome right-click menu operations and improving efficiency.
3. üö´ File and folder ignoring: Support ignoring specific folders and file types, ensuring only the file structure you need is displayed, keeping the file tree concise.
4. üìÇ Automatic opening of exported files: Automatically open files after exporting, no need to manually search for files, saving time and making the workflow smoother.

## Feature Introduction

- After clicking the scan button, open the file selector, choose the folder you want to scan, and start scanning.

### Global Configuration

- Automatically open files: automatically open files after exporting.
- Ignore folders: ignore folders that do not need to be scanned to avoid performance loss or even program unresponsiveness, such as the node_modules folder, which is automatically ignored by the program.
- Ignore folders starting with ".": These folders are hidden by default on MacOS and Linux.
- Scan only folders: ignore all files and only scan folders.
- Ignore files starting with ".": These files are hidden by default on MacOS and Linux.
- Ignore file types: you can choose to ignore unnecessary file types to improve scanning efficiency.
- Scan depth: set the depth of the scan directory, 0 means all depths, and each increment represents a scan depth +1.
- Default name: the default name configuration for exported text.

### Preview area configuration

- Annotation formatting: the format of the fill annotation
- Minimum number of bridge characters: the number of bridge characters displayed at the longest path
- Bridge fill character: enter a single-byte fill character, such as: \*, \#, \$, \-, \@, \_, etc.
- Always show bridges: configure whether to show bridges where there are no comments.
- Export: set the relevant configuration, write the comments, and export the annotation file tree structure.
